# Filter Fatigue

Filter Fatigue is cognitive exhaustion caused by continuous relevance filtering
in high-entropy information environments, where attention is repeatedly taxed
by choice, evaluation, and signal triage.

The term describes a failure mode of modern digital, media, and algorithmic
systems where optimization for relevance increases cognitive load and degrades
meaning over time.
